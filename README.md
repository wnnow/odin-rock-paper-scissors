# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This repository contains a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game project, which is part of The Odin Project's curriculum for learning Javascript fundamentals.  
The code is a JavaScript implementation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the player can select their choice and play against the computer, with the scores being updated and a winner being declared when one of the players reaches a score of 5.
