# Odin-rock-paper-scissors

A minimal Rock–Paper–Scissors game implemented in plain JavaScript (no arrays, loops, or objects). The game runs in the browser console and uses an external JavaScript file linked to an otherwise empty HTML page.

## Description

- The computer randomly chooses "rock", "paper", or "scissors" and stores the choice in a variable the player cannot see.
- The player enters a choice via prompt (no input validation or error handling implemented yet).
- After each round, both choices and the round result are printed to the browser console.
- The match can last up to 5 rounds. Player and computer scores are tracked; the first to reach 3 wins the match.

## Learning goals

- Practice basic JavaScript control flow and functions.
- Learn simple I/O using prompt and the console.
- Prepare to implement input validation, arrays, loops, and objects in later iterations.
